Super market data set is a structured data set showing the sales pattern of 17 products under 3 categories which are Furniture, Office supplies and Technology. At first glance it was observed that some products are losses instead of profits.

The purpose of this analysis is to know the market trends, products with highest sales, regions with highest sales, products and categories with losses.
